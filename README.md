Dear PHP,

PHP changed the way we develop web applications and influenced many developers
and projects.

We want to thank [Rasmus Lerdorf](https://github.com/rlerdorf), the
[PHP group](https://php.net/credits.php), PHP core maintainers, contributors, and
all the people involved in PHP for making the PHP language and making the PHP
ecosytem a better place for developers.

PHP, thank you very much for all you've done and do.

Inspired by the [Thank You Github](https://github.com/thank-you-github/thank-you-github),
and [Thank You Laravel](https://github.com/thank-you-laravel/thank-you-laravel).
